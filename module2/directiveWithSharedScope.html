<div style="color: black; border:1px solid blue">
	<p>This directive has shared scope with the controller</p>
	<p>It also has an attribute directive called shared attribute.</p>
	<p>This is OK, as long as the element and attribute directives don't collide on these issues: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Multiple directives requesting isolated scope.</li>
		<li>Multiple directives publishing a controller under the same</li> name.
		<li>Multiple directives declared with the transclusion option.</li>
		<li>Multiple directives attempting to define a template or</li> templateURL.
	</ul>
